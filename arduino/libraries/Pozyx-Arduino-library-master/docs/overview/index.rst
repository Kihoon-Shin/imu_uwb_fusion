Arduino Pozyx
=============

About
-----

Arduino Pozyx is an Arduino library providing a high-level interface to a Pozyx shield attached to the Arduino,
making the Pozyx shield compatible with Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega, and Arduino Nano.



Features
--------

* Easy to use, allowing both high-level and low-level interfacing with the Pozyx device.
* Straightforward API
* Specialized structs for all important Pozyx data.
* Compatible with Arduino Uno, Mega, and Nano.

Requirements
------------

* Arduino Web IDE or Arduino IDE 1.6+

Installation
------------

Web IDE
~~~~~~~

When you're using the Web IDE, Arduino Pozyx should install automagically
when you include ``<Pozyx.h>``.

Arduino Library Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, the Arduino Pozyx library is easily installable from the Arduino Library
manager. 

From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

To install from source, you'll have to download the source files first and put them in 
your Arduino sketchbook libraries folder. You can do this either by:

* ``git clone https://github.com/pozyxLabs/Pozyx-Arduino-library`` and move the folder to your sketchbook libraries
* Download it from `the repository <https://github.com/pozyxLabs/Pozyx-Arduino-library>`_ and extracting it.
* Downloading the `zip file <https://github.com/pozyxLabs/Pozyx-Arduino-library/archive/master.zip>`_ directly, and extracting it.
